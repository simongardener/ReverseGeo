#  Reverse Geo

A simple little utility app i made for myself to perform a reverse lookup on a latitude and longitude pair.

You can either type the numbers in or use whatever is on the clipboard.

Only basic error error checking on text enterered, its 2 decimal numbers and they are within valid longitude and latitude ranges, either works or tells you the format that it expected.

Result are copied back to clipboard/pasteboard.

Uses the general pasteboard which means it should be fine with handoff. It always picks up latitude and longitude pairs I have on the mac pasteboard. I have however had issues with the results pasting going back to the mac and have had to restart my mac to make it work.
